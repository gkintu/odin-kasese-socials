\par
**Version:** 1.1\par
**Date:** October 26, 2023\par
**Author:** System Architect (AI)\par
**Project Lead:** [Your Name/Team Lead Name]\par
\par
**1. Introduction**\par
Kasese Socials is a new social media platform designed to connect users, allowing them to share updates, follow others, interact with content, and build a community. This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), with an initial focus on frontend development using dummy data, followed by backend implementation. This project will adhere to a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.\par
\par
**2. Goals & Objectives**\par
*   **Primary Goal:** Launch a functional and engaging social media platform with core features enabling user interaction and content sharing, developed with high quality through TDD.\par
*   **Phase 1 Objective:** Develop a complete frontend user interface with mocked data, with components and logic extensively unit and integration tested before implementation.\par
*   **Phase 2 Objective:** Implement the backend, integrate with the frontend, and enable real data persistence and user authentication, with API endpoints and business logic thoroughly tested.\par
*   **User Experience:** Provide an intuitive, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.\par
*   **Technical Foundation:** Build a scalable and maintainable platform using modern web technologies, ensuring code quality and robustness through comprehensive testing.\par
\par
**3. Target Audience**\par
*   General internet users looking for a new platform to connect with others, share life moments, and discover content.\par
*   Initially, the platform will be accessible via web browsers.\par
\par
**4. Functional Requirements**\par
*(All functional requirements will be developed following a TDD approach: write a failing test, write the minimal code to make the test pass, then refactor.)*\par
\par
**4.1. User Authentication & Authorization**\par
    *   **R1.1: Sign-Up:**\par
        *   Users must be able to create an account using an email address and password.\par
        *   Passwords must be securely hashed and stored.\par
    *   **R1.2: Sign-In:**\par
        *   Users must be able to sign in using their registered email and password.\par
        *   Authenticated users will receive a session token (e.g., JWT managed by Passport.js).\par
    *   **R1.3: Guest Sign-In:**\par
        *   A "Guest Sign-In" option will allow visitors to explore the platform's public-facing content (e.g., user profiles, sample posts) without creating an account or supplying credentials. Guest users will have limited interaction capabilities.\par
    *   **R1.4: Protected Routes:**\par
        *   All pages and features, except the sign-in/sign-up page and guest-accessible content, must require user authentication. Unauthorized users attempting to access protected routes will be redirected to the sign-in page.\par
    *   **R1.5: Sign-Out:**\par
        *   Authenticated users must be able to sign out, invalidating their current session.\par
\par
**4.2. User Profiles**\par
    *   **R2.1: Profile Creation:**\par
        *   Upon sign-up, a basic user profile is created.\par
        *   Users can edit their profile information (e.g., display name, bio).\par
        *   Users can upload/update a profile picture. Profile pictures will be hosted on Supabase Storage, and their URLs stored in the database.\par
    *   **R2.2: Profile Page:**\par
        *   Each user will have a dedicated profile page.\par
        *   The profile page must display: Profile picture, Display name, Bio, and a list/grid of posts by the user.\par
\par
**4.3. Social Graph & Interactions**\par
    *   **R3.1: Follow System:**\par
        *   Users can send follow requests (implemented as direct follow for MVP, request logic for future private profiles).\par
        *   Users can unfollow other users.\par
    *   **R3.2: User Index Page:**\par
        *   An index page will list all registered users.\par
        *   Displays profile picture, display name, and "Follow"/"Unfollow" buttons.\par
\par
**4.4. Posts**\par
    *   **R4.1: Post Creation:**\par
        *   Authenticated users can create new posts with text and optional image uploads (hosted on Supabase Storage, URL stored) or an image URL.\par
    *   **R4.2: Post Display:**\par
        *   Posts display author, content, timestamp, likes count, and comments.\par
    *   **R4.3: Post Feed (Index Page):**\par
        *   Main feed shows recent posts from the current user and users they follow (chronological).\par
    *   **R4.4: Liking Posts:**\par
        *   Authenticated users can like/unlike posts. Like count updates.\par
    *   **R4.5: Commenting on Posts:**\par
        *   Authenticated users can add comments. Comments display commenter info, text, and timestamp.\par
\par
**4.5. Real-time Features (Socket.IO)**\par
    *   **R5.1: Real-time Chat (Basic for Post-MVP):**\par
        *   Users can initiate 1-on-1 chats (basic implementation). Messages appear in real-time.\par
    *   **R5.2: Real-time Notifications:**\par
        *   Real-time notifications for new followers, likes, and comments on posts.\par
\par
**5. Non-Functional Requirements**\par

\par
**7. Development Phases & Approach (TDD Integrated)**\par
\par
*   **General TDD Workflow:** For each feature or unit of functionality:\par
    1.  **Red:** Write a test (unit, integration, or API) that describes a piece of functionality and watch it fail.\par
    2.  **Green:** Write the minimum amount of application code required to make the test pass.\par
    3.  **Refactor:** Improve the code (clarity, performance, remove duplication) while ensuring all tests still pass.\par
\par
*   **Phase 0: Setup, Boilerplate & TDD Foundation**\par
    *   Initialize Next.js project.\par
    *   Setup Prisma with PostgreSQL. Define initial User model (test model constraints if possible).\par
    *   Create `seeds.js` with Faker.js.\par
    *   Set up testing environments (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress). Configure ESLint, Prettier.\par
    *   Write initial "smoke tests" to ensure the testing pipeline is working.\par
*   **Phase 1: Frontend First with Dummy Data (TDD Driven)**\par
    *   For each React component:\par
        *   Write tests for component rendering based on props.\par
        *   Write tests for user interactions (e.g., button clicks triggering mock functions).\par
        *   Implement component logic to pass tests.\par
    *   Use static/mocked data. Implement client-side routing (test route navigation).\par
    *   Focus on achieving the desired look and feel, ensuring components are testable.\par
*   **Phase 2: Backend API Development (TDD Driven)**\par
    *   For each API endpoint:\par
        *   Write integration tests (e.g., using Jest + Supertest) to define expected request/response behavior, including validation (Zod), authentication, and error cases.\par
        *   Implement Next.js API route logic (controllers, services) to make tests pass.\par
        *   Define Prisma schema for all models. Write tests for any custom Prisma query logic or service layer functions.\par
    *   Implement authentication logic with Passport.js (test authentication strategies and session management).\par
*   **Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Integration (TDD & BDD aspects)**\par
    *   Write integration tests for frontend components that now fetch data (using React Query mocks initially, then against live dev backend).\par
    *   Replace dummy data with actual API calls.\par
    *   Test end-to-end user flows that span frontend and backend (e.g., user signs up, logs in, creates a post). Cypress will be key here.\par
*   **Phase 4: Real-time Features & Image Handling (TDD)**\par
    *   **Socket.IO:**\par
        *   Backend: Write tests for Socket.IO event handlers (e.g., emitting correct events, handling connections).\par
        *   Frontend: Write tests for Socket.IO client event listeners (e.g., updating state on received events).\par
    *   **Image Upload:**\par
        *   Backend: Test API endpoint for receiving image metadata and returning Supabase URL.\par
        *   Frontend: Test image upload component, including interactions with Supabase client SDK (mocking where necessary).\par
*   **Phase 5: Guest Sign-In & Refinements (TDD)**\par
    *   Implement guest sign-in functionality, testing access restrictions and allowed interactions.\par
    *   Refine UI/UX, writing tests for any new interactions or visual states.\par
    *   Focus on increasing test coverage based on identified gaps.\par
    *   Write E2E tests with Cypress for critical user paths.\par
\par
**8. Success Metrics (Post-Launch)**\par
*   Number of registered users.\par
*   Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU).\par
*   Number of posts created per day/week.\par
*   Average likes and comments per post.\par
*   User retention rate.\par
*   Page load times and application performance.\par
*   **Maintain high test coverage (e.g., >80-90% for critical modules).**\par
*   **Low bug introduction rate post-release.**\par
\par
**9. Open Questions & Future Considerations**\par
*   Detailed design specifications (wireframes, mockups) for UI elements.\par
*   Advanced content moderation policy and tools.\par
*   Scalability strategy for Socket.IO (e.g., using Redis adapter).\par
*   More advanced search and discovery features.\par
*   Privacy settings (e.g., private profiles).\par
*   Password recovery mechanism.\par
*   Third-party sign-in options.\par
*   CI/CD pipeline setup to automate testing and deployment.\par
